Final:

--> We mark variables as final when we know the value of the variable should not be changed once the initial value is set.
--> by marking class final, you are preventing users to create subclasses from your class
--> Marking methods final you are preventing them from being overwritten.
--> initialization blocks are called before any none static methods including the constructors
   static {
        System.out.println("2nd initialization block called");
    }
